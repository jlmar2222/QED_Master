The Census Bureau divides the country up into geographic regions, smaller than counties, called tracts of a few thousand people each, and reports much of its data at the level of tracts. This data set, drawn from the 2011 American Community Survey, contains information on the housing stock and economic circumstances. For each tract, the data file records a large number of variables.


Remember that these are not values for individual houses or families, but summaries of all of the houses and families in the tract.
