# QED_Master

Welcome to the `QED_Master` repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects, exercises, and assignments completed throughout my Master's degree in Quantitative Economics.
This space aims to consolidate and showcase the work developed during this Master. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific project or set of exercises, designed to address different aspects and challenges of the courses I've taken.
