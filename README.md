# QED_Master

Welcome to the `QED_Master` repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects, exercises, and assignments completed throughout my Master's degree in Quantitative Economics.
This space aims to consolidate and showcase the work developed during this Master. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific project or set of exercises, designed to address different aspects and challenges of the courses I've taken.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects included in this repository, along with a brief description of each:

### 1. [**Advance_Econometrics_1: Indirect Inference and Metropolis-Hastings**]
* **Description:** This project explores advanced econometric techniques, specifically focusing on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Indirect Inference for MA(1) processes, and the implementation of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms for AR(2) models under different prior specifications.
* **Technologies/Tools:** MATLAB
* **Contents:** MATLAB scripts (`P1_Indirect_Inference.m`, `P2_MH.m`), and a detailed PDF report (`Advance_Econometrics_Take_Home_Exame_1.pdf`) discussing results and methodologies.


### 2. [**Advance_Econometrics_2: Prediction and Financial Investment**]
* **Description:** This project addresses two distinct problems: an empirical prediction task involving housing price estimation using various parametric and non-parametric machine learning models (OLS, LASSO, Ridge, Decision Trees, Random Forests), and an optional problem estimating the causal effect of 401(k) pension plan participation on financial assets using OLS and Double Machine Learning (Lasso and Random Forest).
* **Technologies/Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, DoubleML)
* **Contents:** Colab notebook (`Advance_Econometrics_Take_Home_Exam_2.ipynb`), and the raw dataset (`calif_penn_2011_2.csv`, `calif_penn_2011.txt`).


### 3. [**Project Name 3**]
* **Description:** [Brief description. E.g., "Development of an interactive web application for [specify functionality, e.g., task management, real-time data visualization]."]
* **Technologies/Tools:** [E.g., Python (Flask/Django), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js]
* **Contents:** [E.g., "application structure, static files, example database."]
